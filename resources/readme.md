This folder contains all the resources used for the card. 

Pictures for the lovelace UI can be found in the [pictures](https://github.com/H89P/niu_card/tree/master/resources/pictures) folder

The lovelace layout is optimized for mobile usage. This means that the orientation of the elements within the picutres-elements cads are positioned slightly different on the desktop browser view!
